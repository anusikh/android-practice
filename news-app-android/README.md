Steps to create app:
- create Models for data
- create activities
- create ViewHolder (extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder) and findBYViewId to get all the elements with their id's
- create adapter (extends RecyclerView.adapter<CustomViewHolder>)
- the custom adapter is used to set the data that we receive from the api
- we then have to create a class called RequestManager where we write the retrofit logic
- then we create OnFetchDataListener interface
- Then we write code in RequestManager to call the functions
- Then we make changes to MainActivity
- Create SelectListener
- In CustomAdapter, in the onBindViewHolder, make the changes
- then make changes in MainActivity, first add "implements SelectListener"
- then we will create a new Activity (DetailsActivity)
- Create an intent (to move from one activity to another) in the onNewsClicked override in MainActivity with putExtra (similar to passing data as props)
- add changes to activity_details.xml
- then make changes in DetailsActivity
- Now we will implement categories, go to activity_main.xml and add buttons
- Intialize buttons in main activity and add implements View.OnClickListener
- in the onClick override generated by View.OnClickListener, simply write logic to call getNewsHeadlines function
- make sure you setOnClickListener to the buttons
- Now we will implement Search
- got to activity_main.xml and create a searchbox
- get the search_view in MainActivity and use setOnQueryTextListener
